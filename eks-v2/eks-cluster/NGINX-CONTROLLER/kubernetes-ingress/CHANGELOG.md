UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.10.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.10.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.10.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.10.0-ubi`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.10.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.8.0 of the chart.
* As a result of [1270](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1270) and [1277](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1277), the Ingress Controller improved validation of Ingress annotations: more annotations are validated and validation errors are reported via events for Ingress resources. Additionally, the default behavior for invalid annotation values was changed: instead of using the default values, the Ingress Controller will reject a resource with an invalid annotation value, which will make clients see `404` responses from NGINX. See this [document](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/advanced-configuration-with-annotations/#validation) to learn more. Before upgrading, ensure the Ingress resources don't have annotations with invalid values. Otherwise, after the upgrade, the Ingress Controller will reject such resources.
* In [1232](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1232) `controller.serviceAccount.imagePullSecrets` was removed. Use the new `controller.serviceAccount.imagePullSecretName` instead.
* The Policy resource was promoted to `v1`. If you used the `alpha1` version, the policies are needed to be recreated with the `v1` version. Before upgrading the Ingress Controller, run the following command to remove the `alpha1` policies CRD (that will also remove all existing `alpha1` policies):
    ```
     kubectl delete crd policies.k8s.nginx.org
    ```
  As part of the upgrade, make sure to create the `v1` policies CRD. See the corresponding instructions for the [manifests](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/#create-custom-resources) and [Helm](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/#upgrading-the-crds) installations.

  Also note that all policies except for `accessControl` are still in preview. To enable them, run the Ingress Controller with `- -enable-preview-policies` command-line argument (`controller.enablePreviewPolicies` Helm parameter).
* It is necessary to update secret resources. See the section UPDATING SECRETS below.

UPDATING SECRETS:

In [1225](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1225), as part of improving how the Ingress Controller handles secret resources, we added a requirement for secrets to be of one of the following types:
- `kubernetes.io/tls` for TLS secrets.
- `nginx.org/jwk` for JWK secrets.
- `nginx.org/ca` for CA secrets.

The Ingress Controller now ignores secrets that are not of a supported type. As a consequence, special upgrade steps are required.

Before upgrading, ensure that the secrets referenced in Ingress, VirtualServer or Policies resources are of a supported type, which is configured via the `type` field. Because that field is immutable, it is necessary to either:
* Recreate the secrets. Note that in this case, the client traffic for the affected resources will be rejected for the period during which a secret doesn't exist in the cluster.
* Create copies of the secrets and update the affected resources to reference the copies. The copies need to be of a supported type. In contrast with the previous options, this will not make NGINX reject the client traffic.

It is also necessary to update the default server secret and the wildcard secret (if it was configured) in case their type is not `kubernetes.io/tls`. The steps depend on how you installed the Ingress Controller: via manifests or Helm. Performing the steps will not lead to a disruption of the client traffic, as the Ingress Controller retains the default and wildcard secrets if they are removed.

For *manifests installation*:
1. Recreate the default server secret and the wildcard secret with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
1. Upgrade the Ingress Controller.

For *Helm installation*, there two cases:
1. If Helm created the secrets (you configured `controller.defaultTLS.cert` and `controller.defaultTLS.key` for the default secret and `controller.wildcardTLS.cert` and `controller.wildcardTLS.key` for the wildcard secret), then no special upgrade steps are required: during the upgrade, the Helm will remove the existing default and wildcard secrets and create new ones with different names with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
1.  If you created the secrets separately from Helm (you configured `controller.defaultTLS.secret` for the default secret and `controller.wildcardTLS.secret` for the wildcard secret):
    1. Recreate the secrets with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
    1. Upgrade to the new Helm release.

NOTES:
* Helm 2 clients are no longer supported due to reaching End of Life: https://helm.sh/blog/helm-2-becomes-unsupported/

CHANGES:
* [1182](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1182) Update NGINX version to 1.19.3.

UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.9.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.9.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.9.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.9.0-ubi`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.9.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.7.0 of the chart.

For Kubernetes >= 1.18, when upgrading using the [manifests](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/), make sure to update the [ClusterRole](deployments/rbac/rbac.yaml) and create the [IngressClass resource](deployments/common/ingress-class.yaml), which is required for Kubernetes >= 1.18. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will fail to start. If you run multiple NGINX Ingress Controllers in the cluster, each Ingress Controller has to have its own IngressClass resource. Make sure your Ingress resources have the `ingressClassName` field or the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation set to the name of the IngressClass resource. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will ignore them.

HELM UPGRADE:
* If you're using custom resources like VirtualServer and TransportServer (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), after you run the `helm upgrade` command, the CRDs will not be upgraded. After running the `helm upgrade` command, run `kubectl apply -f deployments/helm-chart/crds` to upgrade the CRDs.
* For Kubernetes >= 1.18, a dedicated IngressClass resource, which is configured by `controller.ingressClass`, is required per helm release. Ensure `controller.ingressClass` is not set to the name of the IngressClass of other releases or Ingress Controllers. Make sure your Ingress resources have the `ingressClassName` field or the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation set to the value of `controller.ingressClass`. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will ignore them.

NOTES:
* When using Kubernetes >= 1.18 the Ingress Controller will only process resources that belong to its class. See [IngressClass doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/running-multiple-ingress-controllers/#ingress-class) to learn more.
* For Kubernetes >= 1.18, a dedicated IngressClass resource, which is configured by `controller.ingressClass`, is required per helm release. When upgrading or installing releases, ensure `controller.ingressClass` is not set to the name of the IngressClass of other releases or Ingress Controllers.

* [953](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/953): Fix error logging of master/minion ingresses.

HELM CHART:
* The version of the helm chart is now 0.6.0.
* Add new parameters to the Chart: `controller.appprotect.enable`, `controller.globalConfiguration.create`, `controller.globalConfiguration.spec`, `controller.readyStatus.enable`, `controller.readyStatus.port`, `controller.config.annotations`, `controller.reportIngressStatus.annotations`. Added in  [1035](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1035), [1034](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1034), [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029), [1003](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1003) thanks to [RubyLangdon](https://github.com/RubyLangdon).
* [1047](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1047) and [1009](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1009): Change how Helm manages the custom resource definitions (CRDs) to support installing multiple Ingress Controller releases. **Note**: If you're using the custom resources (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), this is a breaking change. See the HELM UPGRADE section below for the upgrade instructions.

CHANGES:
* Update NGINX version to 1.19.1.
* Update NGINX Plus to R22.
* [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029): Add readiness endpoint. The Ingress Controller now exposes a readiness endpoint on port `8081` and the path `/nginx-ready`. The endpoint returns a `200` response after the Ingress Controller finishes the initial configuration of NGINX at the start. The pod template was updated to use that endpoint in a readiness probe.
* [980](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/980): Enable leader election by default.

UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.8.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.8.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.8.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.8.0-ubi`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.8.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.6.0 of the chart.

HELM UPGRADE:

If you're using custom resources like VirtualServer and TransportServer (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), after you run the `helm upgrade` command, the CRDs and the corresponding custom resources will be removed from the cluster. Before upgrading, make sure to back up the custom resources. After running the `helm upgrade` command, run `kubectl apply -f deployments/helm-chart/crds` to re-install the CRDs and then restore the custom resources.

NOTES:
* As part of installing a release, Helm will install the CRDs unless that step is disabled (see the [corresponding doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/)). The installed CRDs include the CRDs for all Ingress Controller features, including the ones disabled by default (like App Protect with `aplogconfs.appprotect.f5.com` and `appolicies.appprotect.f5.com` CRDs).

### 1.7.2

CHANGES:
* Update NGINX Plus version to R22.

HELM CHART:

### 1.7.0

OVERVIEW:

Release 1.7.0 includes:
* Support for TCP, UDP, and TLS Passthrough load balancing with the new configuration resources: TransportServer and GlobalConfiguration. The resources allow users to deliver complex, non-HTTP-based applications from Kubernetes using the NGINX Ingress Controller.
* Support for error pages in VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources. A user can now specify custom error responses for errors returned by backend applications or generated by NGINX, such as a 502 response.
* Improved validation of VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources. kubectl and the Kubernetes API server can now detect violations of the structure of VirtualServer/VirtualServerRoute resources and return an error.
* Support for an operator which manages the lifecycle of the Ingress Controller on Kubernetes or OpenShift. See the [NGINX Ingress Operator GitHub repo](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-operator).

See the [1.7.0 release announcement blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/announcing-nginx-ingress-controller-for-kubernetes-release-1-7-0/), which includes an overview of each feature.

HELM UPGRADE:

In the changelog of Release 1.5.0, we advised not to upgrade the helm chart from `0.2.1` to `0.3.0` unless the mentioned in the changelog problems were acceptable. This release we provide mitigation instructions on how to upgrade from `0.2.1` to `0.3.1` without disruptions.

When you upgrade from `0.2.1` to `0.3.1`, make sure to configure the following parameters:
* `controller.name` is set to `nginx-ingress` or the previously used value in case you customized it. This ensures the Deployment/Daemonset will not be recreated.
* `controller.service.name` is set to `nginx-ingress`. This ensures the service will not be recreated.
* `controller.config.name` is set to `nginx-config`. This ensures the ConfigMap will not be recreated.

Upgrading from `0.3.0` to `0.3.1`: Upgrading is not affected unless you customized `controller.name`. In that case, because of the fix [593](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/593), the upgraded service will have a new selector, and the upgraded pod spec will have a new label. As a result, during an upgrade, the old pods will be immediately excluded from the service. Also, for the Deployment, the old pods will not terminate but continue to run. To terminate the old pods, manually remove the corresponding ReplicaSet.

### 1.5.0

FEATURES:
* [560](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/560): Add new configuration resources -- VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute.
* [554](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/554): Add new Prometheus metrics related to the Ingress Controller's operation (as opposed to NGINX/NGINX Plus metrics).
* [496](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/496): Support a wildcard TLS certificate for TLS-enabled Ingress resources.
* [485](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/485): Support ExternalName services in Ingress backends.

IMPROVEMENTS:
* Add new ConfigMap keys: `keepalive-timeout`, `keepalive-requests`, `access-log-off`, `variables-hash-bucket-size`, `variables-hash-max-size`. Added in [565](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/565), [511](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/511).
* [504](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/504): Run the Prometheus exporter inside the Ingress Controller process instead of a sidecar container.

BUGFIXES:
* [520](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/520): Fix the type of the Prometheus port annotation in manifests.
* [481](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/481): Fix the HSTS support.
* [439](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/439): Fix the validation of the `lb-method` ConfigMap key and `nginx.org/lb-method` annotation.

HELM CHART:
* The version of the helm chart is now 0.3.0.
* The helm chart is now available in our helm chart repo `helm.nginx.com/stable`.
* Add new parameters to the Chart: `controller.service.httpPort.targetPort`, `controller.service.httpsPort.targetPort`, `controller.service.name`, `controller.pod.annotations`, `controller.config.name`, `controller.reportIngressStatus.leaderElectionLockName`, `controller.service.httpPort`, `controller.service.httpsPort`, `controller.service.loadBalancerIP`, `controller.service.loadBalancerSourceRanges`, `controller.tolerations`, `controller.affinity`. Added in [562](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/562), [561](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/561), [553](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/553), [534](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/534) thanks to [Paulo Ribeiro](https://github.com/paigr), [479](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/479) thanks to [Alejandro Llanes](https://github.com/sombralibre),  [468](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/468), [456](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/456).
* [546](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/546): Support deploying multiple Ingress Controllers in a cluster. **Note**: The generated resources have new names that are unique for each Ingress Controller. As a consequence, the name change affects the upgrade. See the HELM UPGRADE section for more information.
* [542](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/542): Reduce the required privileges in the RBAC manifests.

CHANGES:
* Update NGINX version to 1.15.12.
* Prometheus metrics for NGINX/NGINX Plus have new namespace `nginx_ingress`. Examples: `nginx_http_requests_total` -> `nginx_ingress_http_requests_total`, `nginxplus_http_requests_total` -> `nginx_ingress_nginxplus_http_requests_total`.

UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.5.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.5.0` or `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.5.0-alpine`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.5.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.3.0 of the chart.

HELM UPGRADE:

The new version of the helm chart uses different names for the generated resources. This makes it possible to deploy multiple Ingress Controllers in a cluster. However, as a side effect, during the upgrade from the previous version, helm will recreate the resources, instead of updating the existing ones. This, in turn, might cause problems for the following resources:
* Service: If the service was created with the type LoadBalancer, the public IP of the new service might change. Additionally, helm updates the selector of the service, so that the old pods will be immediately excluded from the service.
* Deployment/DaemonSet: Because the resource is recreated, the old pods will be removed and the new ones will be launched, instead of the default Deployment/Daemonset upgrade strategy.
* ConfigMap: After the helm removes the resource, the old Ingress Controller pods will be immediately reconfigured to use the default values of the ConfigMap keys. During a small window between the reconfiguration and the shutdown of the old pods, NGINX will use the configuration with the default values.

We advise not to upgrade to the new version of the helm chart unless the mentioned problems are acceptable for your case. We will provide special upgrade instructions for helm that mitigate the problems for the next minor release of the Ingress Controller (1.5.1).
