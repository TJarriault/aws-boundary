## Prerequisites

  - A [Kubernetes Version Supported by the Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/technical-specifications/#supported-kubernetes-versions)
  - Helm 3.0+.
  - Git.
  
## Getting the Chart Sources

This step is required if you're installing the chart using its sources. Additionally, the step is also required for managing the custom resource definitions (CRDs), which the Ingress Controller requires by default, or for upgrading/deleting the CRDs.

1. Clone the Ingress controller repo:
    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/
    ```
2. Change your working directory to /deployments/helm-chart-dos-arbitrator:
    ```console
    $ cd kubernetes-ingress/deployments/helm-chart-dos-arbitrator
    $ git checkout v2.0.3
    ```

## Adding the Helm Repository

This step is required if you're installing the chart via the helm repository.

```console
$ helm repo add nginx-stable https://helm.nginx.com/stable
$ helm repo update
```

## Installing the Chart

### Installing via Helm Repository

To install the chart with the release name my-release-dos (my-release-dos is the name that you choose):

```console
$ helm install my-release-dos nginx-stable/nginx-appprotect-dos-arbitrator
```


### Installing Using Chart Sources

To install the chart with the release name my-release-dos (my-release-dos is the name that you choose):

```console
$ helm install my-release-dos .
```

The command deploys the App Protect Dos Arbitrator in your Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The configuration section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Upgrading the Chart

```

## Uninstalling the Chart
