This document explains how to pull an NGINX Plus Ingress Controller image from the F5 Docker registry using your NGINX Ingress Controller subscription certificate and key. **Please note that an NGINX Plus subscription certificate and key will not work with the F5 Docker registry.** You can also get the image using alternative methods:

* Please see [here](/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/using-the-jwt-token-docker-secret) for details on how to use the JWT token to use the image directly in your Kubernetes cluster.
* Please see [here](/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/building-ingress-controller-image) for information on how to build an Ingress Controller image using the source code from this repository and your NGINX Plus subscription certificate and key.
* For NGINX Ingress Controller based on NGINX OSS, we provide the image through DockerHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you can pull the image, make sure that the following software is installed on your machine:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) v18.09+
* For NGINX Ingress Controller, you must have the NGINX Ingress Controller subscription -- download the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller (per instance) certificate (`nginx-repo.crt`) and the key (`nginx-repo.key`) from [MyF5](https://myf5.com).

## Pulling the Image using Docker and Pushing It to the Private Registry

1. First, configure the Docker environment to use certificate-based client-server authentication with the F5 Container registry - `private-registry.nginx.com`. 
   To do so in a Linux based environment, create a `private-registry.nginx.com` directory under `/etc/docker/certs.d` and create a certificate `client.cert` (using `nginx-repo.crt` - please note that the certificate MUST have the `.cert` suffix, not `.crt`) and a key `client.key` (using `nginx-repo.key`). See [this document](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/certificates/) for more details.

   ```
   # mkdir /etc/docker/certs.d/private-registry.nginx.com
   # cp nginx-repo.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/private-registry.nginx.com/client.cert
   # cp nginx-repo.key /etc/docker/certs.d/private-registry.nginx.com/client.key
   ```

    > **Note**: The preceding example is operating-system specific and is for illustrative purposes only. You should consult your operating system documentation for creating an os-provided bundled certificate chain. For example, to configure this for Docker Desktop for Mac or Docker Desktop for Windows, see [this document](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#add-client-certificates) or [this document](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#how-do-i-add-client-certificates) for more details.

2. Use docker to pull the required image from `private-registry.nginx.com`. Choose the image from the available images listed [here](nginx-ingress-controller/technical-specifications/#images-with-nginx-plus).
   For NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, pull from `private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress`, e.g.:
   ```
   $ docker pull private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress:1.12.0
   ```

   For NGINX Plus Ingress Controller with App Protect, pull from `private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress`, e.g.:
   ```
   $ docker pull private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress:1.12.0
   ```
   
   To list the available image tags for the repositories, you can also use the Docker registry API, e.g.:
   ```
   $ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq
   {
    "name": "nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress",
    "tags": [
        "2.0.3-alpine",
        "2.0.3-ot",
        "2.0.3-ubi",
        "2.0.3"
    ]
    }

   $ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq
   {
    "name": "nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress",
    "tags": [
        "2.0.3-ubi",
        "2.0.3"
    ]
    }
   ```

3. Tag and push the image to your private registry.
   Make sure to run the `docker login` command first to log in to the registry.
   ```
   $ docker tag private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress:1.12.0 <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress:1.12.0
   $ docker push <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress:1.12.0
   ```
   
   or for NGINX App Protect enabled image
   ```
   $ docker tag private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress:1.12.0 <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress:1.12.0
   $ docker push <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress:1.12.0
   ```
